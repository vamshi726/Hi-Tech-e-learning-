# Hi-Tech-e-learning-
This project is submission of Cal Hacks 8.0

To learn different new skills through free online courses. A wide range of classes is available such as Finance, Engineering, Information Technology, fitness courses and many others. Importantly, you can learn at your own pace and the timings that are suitable for you.

<h1>🖥️ What it does</h1>
Studying online gives you more flexibility. You can work and fit your work schedule (and your hobbies) around your coursework more easily; even more so if you are taking an asynchronous class: an online class where you don’t have to log in at a specific time for a live session but you can study and interact with your instructor and your fellow classmates at your own pace through, for example, the discussion forum.
